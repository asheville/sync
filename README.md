This repository contains the source code for an app that synchronizes data from sources to storage on behalf of users.

See also [the API documentation](http://neotoma.github.io/sync-server/) or [the Neotoma project in general](https://github.com/neotoma/documentation).

## Setup

SSL certificates and the following environment variables are managed by [Park Ranger](https://github.com/markmhx/park-ranger):

### Required

- `SYNC_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET`: Secret, non-obvious string used to prevent session tampering (e.g. `oc]7kwM)R*UX3&` but *generate your own*)

### Optional

- `SYNC_SERVER_DIR`: Local path to app base directory (defaults to `/var/www/sync-server`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_HOST`: Host address for the app (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_HTTP_PORT`: Port through which to run the app with HTTP (defaults `9001`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT`: Port through which to run the app with HTTPS (defaults to `9002`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_LOGGER_FILE_PATH`: File system path where to store log events (e.g. `/tmp/sync-server.log`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_LOGGER_MAILER_LEVEL`: Numeric value between 0 and 5 to designate level of errors to email to SYNC_SERVER_MAILER_LOGGER_EMAIL
- `SYNC_SERVER_MAILER_LOGGER_EMAIL`: Email to which logger errors should be sent
- `SYNC_SERVER_MAILER_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`: Email address to which to restrict all email delivery for testing purposes
- `SYNC_SERVER_MAILER_SENDER_EMAIL`: Email address used by app to send email (e.g. `support@example.com`; required to send email)
- `SYNC_SERVER_MONGODB_DATABASE`: Name of a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) database (defaults to `sync_server`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_MONGODB_HOST`: Host address for a MongoDB service (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_MONGODB_PORT`: Port through which to access a MongoDB service (defaults to `27017`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_NAME`: Name used by the app to identity itself with users (defaults to `Neotoma`)
- `SYNC_SERVER_SENDGRID_API_KEY`: API key for SendGrid account for delivering email (required to send email)
- `SYNC_SERVER_WEB_HOST`: Host address for the web client intended to communicate with the app exclusively via cross-origin HTTP requests; used to set HTTP access control (CORS) (e.g. `http://example.com:9019`)

Tests will use Park Ranger to establish environment variables available for the "test" environment after loading those for whatever environment initially indicated upon execution. 

Be sure to set any of the above variables to a different value within `.env-test` if you don't want the tests to use the variables available for the indicated environment. 

For example, set a different `SYNC_SERVER_MONGODB_DATABASE` to prevent your development database from getting reset every time you run tests, and `SYNC_SERVER_SENDGRID_API_KEY` to `null` to prevent email delivery.

## Running the server

Once the environment is ready per above, and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed, simply run `npm install` to install dependencies in the `node_modules` directory and `npm start` to fire the server up.

## Developing and deploying the server

Deployment scripts are available through [Hoist](https://github.com/markmhx/grunt-hoist). The following are also supported:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app and automatically reloads it when code changes are made during development
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests locally
